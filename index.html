            <h2>About Me And Academic History</h2>
            <p> Hello World! My name is Maruf Hossain. I'm an animator and programmer with a passion for crafting immersive experiences 
                and developing efficient solutions. I have a knack for problem-solving and pride myself on being an effective communicator, 
                I am a bit of a perfectionist as my friends say, leading me to spend way more time on projects then is necessary or just avoid 
                them entirely if I feel as if I am not doing a good job. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Programming at Seneca College. 
                My journey in the tech world began in high school, where I specialized in Computer Science, and I am also a self-taught animator. 
                I am on track to earn my degree in 2026, and I plan to further enhance my skills by pursuing a diploma in animation 
                to formally certify my abilities. </p>
